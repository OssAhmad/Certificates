# Certificates
This repository will hold all my certificates and proof that I have watched and studied different courses.

## Structure 
- Courses that I have licenses for will give only a brief overview of the syllabus and a file containing my certifacte, be it a .pdf or an image file. 
- Courses that do not provide me a license I will produce an unofficial license of my own and provide in it my score out of 100 and whether I fully finished the course or not.
- For courses that have unofficial lisences I will provide my exams, my problem sets and other things that I have done to accridit myself in order to caculate my score. 
- If a course is listed in this folder it means that I have finished taking it, and finihsed it with passing grades, although I might not have mastered all of the material.

## Heads-Up 
- No institution that I am associated with varifes the content of this repository, my reputation is the only garateour of this certifications.
- I do not lie.
- All of the information in the folders and certifications are true and tabulated carefully to repersent the Truth.
